KeyBinds <
	F1:: Starts Script
	F2:: Coordinates Teller

AHK\Click.ahk just uses x and y that i got from my browser lol, you probably will need to recalibrate.
KeyBinds <
	F1:: Starts Script
	F2:: Coordinates Teller
	F3:: Change Coordinates
	F5:: Cancel Current Change (if you are on repost, itll go to scroll, if you are on scroll, itll finish will the same coordinates without changing it)
