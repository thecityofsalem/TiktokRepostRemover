There will be folders (sorting what app is needed) ill try to make it hella accessible to everybody.

I heavily suggest the AHK, it's very accurate because it actually looks for the repost button on your monitor.

# These are the options so far,
1. AHK, (image, and static x+y coords)
2. Python (static x+y coords)
(idk any more to do)
lmk if there is issues ill try to resolve them.

# Update 4/6/2025 6:55pm.
- ahk finished
- python x+y done,
-
